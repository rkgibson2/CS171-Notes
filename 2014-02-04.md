In JavaScript, functions are first class citizens!

* They are important, you can do lots with them
* They are variables, so you can assign things to them or assign them to other variables

You can declare functions as:

	function f1(x) {
		return a
	}

but this is the same (basically) as:

	var f2 = function(x) {
		return a
	}

BOTH DO THE SAME THING

Can also assign properties to functions
f1.foo = 3
This is just a simple variable and assignment

---------------------------------------------------

Can also "curry" functions
Functions have arguments, but you can create new functions that call the original functinos some arguments already put in

Functions can return other functions
